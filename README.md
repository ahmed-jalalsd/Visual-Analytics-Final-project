As a student, choosing a suitable university is a huge task especially if the student is going abroad
The journey towards finding the perfect university would be a lot less daunting if the student has a clear 
idea of the tools available to help him/her right from the start of the search

Our project aims to tackle this issue, by providing the students a digital and interactive tool to choose 
from the top 400 universities in the world using a dataset provided by THE (Times Higher Education) world university ranking. 
The dataset has the best 400 universities for each year from 2011 to 2016.

Data Set Used
